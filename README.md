# MyReads Project

This project provides three bookshelves to categorize your books:

- Currently Reading
- Wants to Read
- Read

You can move a book from one shelf to the other by clicking the green arrow under each book and
selecting the new shelf. If you select "None" the book is removed for all shelves.

You can also search for new books by clicking the "+" button on the lower right of the screen.
Once in the /search page just input your search in the big textinput and the results should
appear shortly. Click the green arrow to add a book to a shelf.

To run the project locally clone the repo and run:

`npm install`
`npm start`

You need npm installed to run this project.

Thanks!
